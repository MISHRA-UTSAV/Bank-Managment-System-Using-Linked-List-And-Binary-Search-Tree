# Bank-Managment-System-Using-Linked-List-And-Binary-Search-Tree

In this 21st century, people still struggle to make use of the manual banking system. Every citizen is required 
to physically go to a bank and provide legions of paperwork in order to open a new bank account or to update their 
existing account in any sort of manner. This socio-economic issue has inspired us to come up with a fully flexible bank 
management system that provides remote banking services. The existing system requires the bank’s customer to physically visit 
the bank and verify their identity before proceeding further with their work. This hinders time efficiency and bids more manual 
labour. The proposed system solves the same by providing a web based solution that offers online banking services which can be 
accessed by new and existing users of the bank. This would also encourage more customers to join this particular bank, 
owing to its efficiency. Moreover, we have built this algorithm using BST and Linked list data structure. This has proved to 
improve memory efficiency in comparison with the traditional array method. Deletion done using linked list emphasizes optimum 
use of memory and enhances knowledge upon dynamic memory allocation. File handling mechanism is incorporated to store various 
bank documents and simultaneously used for computations. Index Terms—Bank Management System, BST, Linked List, C language,
